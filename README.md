# PINNs vs Greedy in Reduced Basis Method for parametric Advection-Diffusion problem

This software provides all the functions needed to compute approximate
solutions to a parametric advection-diffusion problem using the Physics
Informed Neural Network (PINN) and the Reduced Order Model (ROM) via the
greedy algorithm. The code to compute the online accuracy and speed-up with 
respect to Finite Element Methods (FEM) is provided.
